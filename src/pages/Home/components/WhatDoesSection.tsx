            REACH Dobby is the Best In Class specialized software tool designed for the textile industry, focusing on the creation and management of dobby designs. It enables users to easily generate a variety of weave structures, including simple, double, and compound types, making it ideal for textile designers and manufacturers. 
          </p>

          <p className="text-lg text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
            REACH Dobby features a built-in graphical editor equipped with essential tools such as cut, copy, paste, select, undo, redo, mirror, rotate, invert, and duplicate for efficient weave editing. It supports repeat modes for uniform pattern reproduction and automatic pattern generation based on selected designs.

          <p className="text-lg text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
            Key functionalities include the ability to view reverse, mirror, and inverted weaves; add shafts and picks; and merge weaves to form complex patterns.
          </p>

          <p className="text-lg text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
            REACH Dobby comes with inbuilt libraries for weaves, colors, and yarns, along with dedicated editors like the weave editor. It provides photorealistic fabric simulations for the front side of woven designs, incorporating options for simple yarn, melange, mouline, and combined extra wrap/weft effects. The software also generates technical data, yarn consumption reports, and print outputs that mimic real fabric textures and color shades.
          </p>

          <p className="text-lg text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
            Additionally, it allows for the creation of optimal fabric designs through virtual simulations, generation of peg plans and drafts, and input of material and technological parameters for yarns and fabrics. Users can maintain a data bank for quick retrieval of weave designs, create and display weaving drafts and patterns, experiment with various colors and combinations, and reuse existing designs. Other features encompass program parameters, article setups, weave parameters, point and line tools for creation/editing, and warp/weft pattern development.
